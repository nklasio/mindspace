# MindScape

MindScape is a mental health app designed to help users track their sleep and protect against nightmares.

> This project is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for public use.
> The project currently only implements a dummy UI and tracking of sleep data using the Apple HealthKit API and an Apple Watch.

## Planned Features

- Track sleep quality and duration
- Protect against nightmares
- Analyze sleep patterns
- Receive personalized sleep recommendations

To achieve this, we are looking into analyzing the user's sleep patterns and using machine learning to predict / detect nightmares in real-time and alert the user.
As this requires a lot of data, we are not expecting to achieve this in the near future.

## Why are we working on this?

I personally do not suffer from nightmares, my sleep is generally good.
However, I have friends and family members who do suffer from nightmares and sleep disturbances.
I have seen how this can affect their mental health and overall well-being.

I am working on this project to help people who suffer from nightmares and sleep disturbances.
As this is just a hobby project, and I am not a professional in mental health, sleep science or even software development, take everything here with a grain of salt.
If you are suffering from nightmares and sleep disturbances, please seek professional help.
